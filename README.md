# PC Link ‚Äì Your PC, Anywhere

**PC Link** turns any computer into a secure, web-accessible control center.
From any browser, anywhere, you can:

* **Sync clipboards in real time** between your PC and all connected devices.
* **Browse and transfer files** instantly across platforms.
* **Run remote shell commands** (securely whitelisted) for powerful admin control.

No heavy installs. No vendor lock-in. Just Node.js, your PC, and a secure connection.
Whether you‚Äôre on your phone, tablet, or another laptop halfway across the world ‚Äî if you can open a browser, you can control your PC.

##  Core Features

### Real-Time Clipboard Synchronization

* Automatic clipboard monitoring and broadcasting from host to connected browsers.
* Optional remote clipboard modification (configurable).
* Cross-device clipboard sharing between browser clients.

### Secure File System Access

* Sandboxed file browsing with a configurable root directory.
* Bidirectional file transfer between host and browsers.
* Peer-to-peer file sharing through a server relay for browser-to-browser transfers.
* Drag-and-drop file upload support.

### Remote System Control

* Optional remote shell command execution with whitelist support.
* Multi-device connection management with presence tracking.
* Real-time WebSocket communication for instant updates.

##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 14+
* npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Required: secure server token
SERVER_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# Optional: file system root directory (defaults to user home)
ROOT_DIR=/Users/username/Shared

# Optional: enable remote clipboard modification
ALLOW_REMOTE_CLIPBOARD_SET=true

# Optional: enable shell access (disabled by default)
ALLOW_SHELL=false

# Optional: whitelist shell commands (if ALLOW_SHELL=true)
SHELL_WHITELIST=ls,pwd,whoami,git

# Optional: server port (default: 8443)
PORT=8443
```

### Run the Server

```bash
npm start
```

Server will be available at:

```
http://localhost:8443
```

### Remote Access via Internet (ngrok recommended)

```bash
npm install -g ngrok
ngrok http 8443
```

Use the provided HTTPS URL, replacing `https://` with `wss://` for WebSocket connections.

##  Security Best Practices

* **Tokens**: Treat `SERVER_TOKEN` like a password. Use `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate it.
* **File System**: Never set `ROOT_DIR` to `/` or `C:\`. Use dedicated, low-risk directories.
* **Shell Access**: Keep disabled unless required. Always whitelist commands.
* **Network**: Use HTTPS/WSS in production and consider VPN access.

## üõ† Architecture Overview

**Server** (`server/server.js`)

* Express.js HTTP server with WebSocket support
* Token-based authentication middleware
* RESTful API endpoints for file operations
* Real-time WebSocket routing

**Host Integration** (`server/hostIntegration.js`)

* Cross-platform clipboard monitoring and manipulation
* Sandboxed file system operations with path traversal protection
* Optional shell command execution with whitelisting

**Web Client** (`public/app.js`)

* Modern JavaScript ES6 modules
* WebSocket client with auto-reconnection
* File drag-and-drop interface
* Real-time clipboard and device status updates

**Protocol Layer** (`shared/protocol.js`)

* Standardized message types for client-server communication
* Error handling and validation

---

##  Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: Client connects with `SERVER_TOKEN` and device ID.
2. **Registration**: Server validates and registers the device.
3. **Real-time Sync**: WebSocket messages manage clipboard, file transfers, and commands.
4. **File Ops**: HTTP endpoints stream uploads/downloads.
5. **Cleanup**: Device deregisters automatically on disconnect.

##  API Reference

### WebSocket Messages

```json
{ "type": "AUTH", "token": "your-token", "deviceId": "unique-device-id" }
{ "type": "CLIPBOARD_UPDATE", "data": "clipboard-content", "source": "device-id" }
{ "type": "SET_HOST_CLIPBOARD", "data": "new-content" }
{ "type": "FILE_START", "fileName": "document.pdf", "fileSize": 1024000, "target": "device-id" }
```

### HTTP Endpoints

* `GET /api/fs/list?path=./Documents` ‚Äì List directory contents
* `GET /api/fs/download?path=./file.txt` ‚Äì Download file
* `POST /api/fs/upload` ‚Äì Upload files
* `POST /api/shell` ‚Äì Execute shell command (if enabled)

##  Deployment Options

**Local Network**

```bash
npm start
```

Access via: `http://your-local-ip:8443`

**Internet (ngrok)**

```bash
npm start
ngrok http 8443
```

**Reverse Proxy (nginx)**

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8443;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
}
```
